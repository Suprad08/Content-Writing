1. The game will start with a shuffled deck of 52 cards laid out on the screen in 7 columns.
The first column will have one card, the second column will have two cards, and so on, until the seventh column, which will have seven cards.

2. The objective of Solitaire is to move all of the cards from the columns to the four foundation piles in the upper-right corner of the screen.
The foundation piles must be built up in suit from Ace to King (e.g. Ace of Spades, Two of Spades, Three of Spades, etc.).

3. To move cards around the board, you can click on a card and drag it to a new location.
You can move cards to the foundation piles, to the other columns, or to the waste pile in the upper-left corner of the screen.

4. Only the top card of each column and the waste pile is face up, while the rest of the cards are face down.
You can turn over a face-down card by clicking on it.

5. When you move a card to a new location, you must follow the rules of Solitaire. 
You can move a card to a column if it is one rank lower and a different color (e.g. a black Seven can be placed on a red Eight).

6. You can move multiple cards at once by clicking and dragging a sequence of cards. 
The cards must be in descending order and alternating colors (e.g. a black King can be placed on a red Queen).

7. If you run out of moves on the board, you can draw cards from the deck in the upper-left corner of the screen. 
Click on the deck to draw one card, or click and drag the deck to draw three cards at once.

8. You can only go through the deck once in Solitaire, so use your cards wisely.

10. Keep moving cards around the board and building up the foundation piles until you have all of the cards in the foundation piles in the correct order. 
Once you do, you win the game!

That's it! With these steps, you should be able to play Solitaire and enjoy a classic game of cards from our app. Good luck!
